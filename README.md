Data analysis performed by Exeter Cycling Campaign.

Exeter Cycling Campaign works to ensure our lovely city thrives & that people are enabled to cycle, scoot & walk.

We are working for a comprehensive, convenient and connected network of cycle paths. We want everyone, regardless of age and ability, to be able to enjoy the benefits of cycling, safely and easily.

Our data analysis contained in this repository seeks to promote data-driven decision making.  We make our code and plots openly available for anyone to look at in the interests of fairness and transparency.

Some analysis highlights:

* **Cycle to Traffic Queues**: Ever wondered how many cars are being taken off the road by people who cycle, wheel or scoot? So did we!  How long would a traffic jam be if all these cars were on the road instead?  Find out more :point_right: [cycle-to-traffic-queues.ipynb](/cycle-to-traffic-queues.ipynb)
